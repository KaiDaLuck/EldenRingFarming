# EldenRingFarmingAFK
Automatic Farming Script for Elden Ring

All versions only work if the "directkeys.py" file is in the same folder as the script.

Only works with python installed.
- You do that by typing "python" in cmd, after which microsoft store opens, where you can install it.

In order to use most versions you need to install the "keyboard" package. To install keyboard on Windows 10/11:
- type "py -m pip install --upgrade keyboard" or "python -m pip install --upgrade keyboard" in command line (cmd).

Ingame requirements:
- Hold the sacred relic sword in both hands
- rebind "use skill" to 'J' in the settings
- mark the "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" site of grace in your grace menu on the map. do that by standing or sitting at the site of grace and pressing the following buttons:
-     XBOX Controller: MENU, Y, RS
-     PS Controller: SHARE, TRIANGLE, R3
-     Keyboard: G, F, Z
