# EldenRingFarmingAFK
Automatic Farming Script for Elden Ring

Only works with python installed.
In order to use most versions you need to install the "keyboard" package.
All versions only work if the "directkeys.py" file is in the same folder as the script.

To install keyboard on Windows 10/11:
- type "py -m pip install --upgrade keyboard" in command line.

Ingame requirements:
- Hold the sacred relic sword in both hands
- rebind "use skill" to 'J' in settings
- mark the "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" site of grace in your grace menu on the map.
