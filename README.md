Automatic Farming Script for Elden Ring

In order to use v.6 you need to install the "keyboard" package.
All versions only work if the "directkeys.py" file is in the same folder as the script.

Ingame requirements for each version:
- Hold the sacred relic sword in both hands
- rebind "use skill" to 'J' in settings
- mark the "Palace Approach Ledge-Road" site of grace in your grace menu on the map.

1: Don't use it, it was made just to test directkeys.

2: Also don't use it, it's slow and deviates from the grace.

3: Very slow, but usable.

4: Good if you still have aggro after using the wave of gold skill once.

5: Use it if you instakill all the albinaurics

6: Just an improved version of v.5, because you now can stop the script in (almost) any given time by holding "enter" (Needs keyboard package to be installed)
